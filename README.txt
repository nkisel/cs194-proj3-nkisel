I have left a number of demos that should be runnable with the provided 
files at the bottom of main.py, which hosts all of the code for this
project. Enumerated below are the corresponding demos & functions 
for each section:

Defining Correspondences
    select_points
    retrieve_points & parse_points
    display_points & display_population_points
    triangles

Computing the "Mid-way Face"
    computeAffine
    apply_masked_affine
    bool_mask

The Morph Sequence
    linear, ease_in_out
    mix
    midway_image
    transform, transform_frames

The "Mean face" of a population
    midway
    transform_frames

Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean
    linear_extrapolate
    transform_frames

Bells and Whistles
    CLASS MUSIC VIDEO
        transform_frames

    BODYBUILDERS MUSIC VIDEO
        transform_frames_many
        points_to_video / generate_video

        Demo: generate_bodybuilder_video

I am assuming for now that I am the only participant in the class music video.
If by chance someone else joins in after my submission, please compensate me
accordingly.
